# Devour Map üï∑Ô∏è
## A map to assist at Devour Inn
### How the Game works
Since on this map you need to burn the eggs on the altar with the same icon, and the location of these altars is random, remember that the location of the altars is difficult.

### How the website works

The user interacts with the front end of the web application, which serves as the interface for their actions. The front end establishes a WebSocket connection with a TypeScript-based API to enable real-time communication. This connection ensures that the positions of all pieces within the application are continuously updated and synchronized across all users in the same room.
